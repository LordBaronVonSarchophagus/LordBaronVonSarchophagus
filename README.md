- 👋 Hi, I’m @LordBaronVonSarchophagus
- 👀 I’m interested in robotics, bionics, cybernetics, rocketry, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning mechatronics and automation at NDSCS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on robotics and rocketry projects
- I usually act in more of a directorial role, I don't write a lot of code myself
- you probably came here from ScienceandPizza.com, and if you haven't you should go check that out
